On windows, make sure you have a sh.exe in your path environment variables.
Use the system search to look up "Environment Variables", go to system
variables, select Path, then click edit. Add the path to your sh.exe

using LLVM for the clang compiler
tested on the installation: LLVM-18.1.8-win64.exe
When installing LLVM, select "Add LLVM to the system PATH for all users".
Clang also requires another compiler installed on your system, such as MSVC
or MinGW. If you have neither, installing visual studio should be sufficient.
